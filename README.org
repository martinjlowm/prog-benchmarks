#+TITLE: Operation benchmarks for common programming languages

This project consists of a set of small benchmark scripts that reside in
=src/<lang>/=. Every language directory contains a benchmark Bash script that
initiates a Docker container that invokes scripts of interest. It has been
pre-configured with a bunch of different versions of JavaScript (Node.js),
Python, Ruby and Lua.

Initially, the Docker image needs to be built using

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker build -t prog-benchmarks
#+END_SRC

To use the build (for JavaScript for example), run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run -it prog-benchmarks "nodenv shell 9.4.0 && node <<EOF
$(cat $f)
EOF"
#+END_SRC

Where ~$f~ is a Bash variable of a file name.
